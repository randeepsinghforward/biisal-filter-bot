## Credits
- Jai Shree Krishna.. I'm Biisal, I didn't create this bot alone. This bot is the result of many days of struggle (Approximately two years ), and I've implemented features in it. There are many developers from whom I've gathered ideas to add new features. I can't remember all, but a few names come to mind: Cynite, GreyMatters, LazyDeveloper, the owner of Ben Filter Bot,Adarsh and many others.Thanks to All ✨
